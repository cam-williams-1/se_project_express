# WTWR (What to Wear): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## This is a Back End Project

This project upholds the WTWR project, created in React, that implements a server, proper routing and HTTP requests, and sets up a local database run with mongoDB. Can use mongoDB Compass to see information as well.

You can use this to add, update, or delete Users & Clothing Items from the database.

# Technologies Utilized
